# Summarize Long PDFs with ChatGPT

This Notebook has two main parts / features:

1. **Text extraction** from PDFs, including those containing only image data (i.e., **scanned documents**)
2. **Summarization** with ChatGPT using OpenAI's web API, and solving the problem of documents **too long** for ChatGPT's context window.

It's intended as a **self-contained tutorial**, so I won't go into more detail here!
